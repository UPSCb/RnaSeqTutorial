For the practical, you will replicate what we have been doing in the tutorial. 
However, there are a few twists.

The data has been quantified with `salmon` [@Patro2017] instead of `kallisto` 
[@Bray2016]. The data is in the folder `share/leaf/salmon`. When reading the 
abundance data in, you need to give additional arguments to `readAbundance`, 
namely the `pattern`: _*\\.sf_ and the `type`: _salmon_.

When performing the _DE_ analysis, you will need to change the design to match
your observation from the biological QA you will have performed. To that end,
you can provide a design as an argument to the `createDESeqDataSet` function, 
using the `design` argument; _e.g._ 
`dds <- createDESeqDataSet(counts,samples,design= ...)` where you replace `...`.

```{r inv-1605, echo=FALSE}
    endQuest()
