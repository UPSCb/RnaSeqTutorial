  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: Although many next-generation sequencing (NGS)
		  read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find
		  any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements
		  in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end
		  data and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as
		  a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which
		  could correctly handle paired-end data.

		  RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is
		  demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free
		  tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at
		  least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that
		  produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq
		  data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of
		  the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short
		  read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the
		  sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq
		  aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping
		  speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.

		  RESULTS: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE
		  Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced
		  Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based
		  on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
		  that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in
		  uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and
		  stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a
		  factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human
		  genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on
		  a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving
		  alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to
		  unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
		  discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
		  transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA
		  sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
		  transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
		  experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice
		  junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the
		  high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. Availability
		  and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++
		  code. STAR is free open source software distributed under
		  GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from
		  http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.

  title		= {A practical algorithm for finding maximal exact matches in
		  large sequence datasets using sparse suffix arrays},
  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing technologies place
		  ever increasing demands on existing algorithms for sequence
		  analysis. Algorithms for computing maximal exact matches
		  (MEMs) between sequences appear in two contexts where
		  high-throughput sequencing will vastly increase the volume
		  of sequence data: (i) seeding alignments of high-throughput
		  reads for genome assembly and (ii) designating anchor
		  points for genome-genome comparisons.

		  RESULTS: We introduce a new algorithm for finding MEMs. The
		  algorithm leverages a sparse suffix array (SA), a text
		  index that stores every K-th position of the text. In
		  contrast to a full text index that stores every position of
		  the text, a sparse SA occupies much less memory. Even
		  though we use a sparse index, the output of our algorithm
		  is the same as a full text index algorithm as long as the
		  space between the indexed suffixes is not greater than a
		  minimum length of a MEM. By relying on partial matches and
		  additional text scanning between indexed positions, the
		  algorithm trades memory for extra computation. The reduced
		  memory usage makes it possible to determine MEMs between
		  significantly longer sequences.

		  AVAILABILITY: Source code for the algorithm is available
		  under a BSD open source license at
		  http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/mems. The implementation
		  can serve as a drop-in replacement for the MEMs algorithm
		  in MUMmer 3.},

		  exploration},
  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The throughput of commercially available
		  sequencers has recently significantly increased. It has
		  reached the point where measuring the RNA expression by the
		  depth of coverage has become feasible even for largest
		  genomes. The development of software tools is constantly
		  following the progress of biological hardware. In
		  particular, as RNA sequencing software can be regarded
		  genome browsers, exon junction tools and statistical tools
		  operating on counts of reads in predefined regions. The
		  library rnaSeqMap, freely available via Bioconductor, is an
		  RNA sequencing software which is independent of any
		  biological hardware platform. It is based upon standard
		  Bioconductor infrastructure for sequencing data and
		  includes several novel features focused on deeper
		  understanding of coverage expression profiles and discovery
		  of novel transcription regions.

		  RESULTS: rnaSeqMap is a toolbox for analyses that may be
		  performed with the use of gene annotations or
		  alternatively, in an unsupervised mode, on any genomic
		  region to find novel or non-standard transcripts. The data
		  back-end may be a MySQL database or a set of files in
		  standard BAM format. The processing in R can be run on a
		  machine without any particular hardware requirements, and
		  scales linearly with the number of genomic loci and number
		  of samples analyzed. The main features of rnaSeqMap include
		  coverage operations, discovering irreducible regions of
		  high expression, significance search and splicing analyses
		  with nucleotide granularity.

		  CONCLUSIONS: This software may be used for a range of
		  applications related to RNA sequencing by building
		  customized analysis pipelines. The applicability and
		  precision is expected to increase in parallel with the
		  progress of the genome coverage in sequencers.},

		  uncertainty},
  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq is a promising new technology for
		  accurately measuring gene expression levels. Expression
		  estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively
		  short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript
		  set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts
		  from which they are derived, a single read may map to
		  multiple genes and isoforms, complicating expression
		  analyses. Previous computational methods either discard
		  reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to
		  genes heuristically. RESULTS: We present a generative
		  statistical model and associated inference methods that
		  handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner.
		  Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we
		  show that our method is more accurate than previous
		  methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling
		  read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the
		  estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform
		  expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is
		  capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions.
		  Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION:  Next-generation sequencing technologies
		  generate millions of short sequence reads, which are
		  usually aligned to a reference genome. In many
		  applications, the key information required for downstream
		  analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic

		  of counting reads is called read summarization. Read
		  summarization is required for a great variety of genomic
		  analyses but has so far received relatively little
		  attention in the literature.

		  RESULTS:  We present featureCounts, a read summarization

		  implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature
		  blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than

		  it is possible to use RNA-seq to sequence mRNA. In the

		  RESULTS: We present a software package named Oases designed

		  this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering

  title		= {Flexible analysis of RNA-seq data using mixed effects
		  models},
  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: Most methods for estimating differential
		  expression from RNA-seq are based on statistics that
		  compare normalized read counts between treatment classes.
		  Unfortunately, reads are in general too short to be mapped
		  unambiguously to features of interest, such as genes,
		  isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms. There are methods
		  for estimating expression levels that account for this
		  source of ambiguity. However, the uncertainty is not
		  generally accounted for in downstream analysis of gene
		  expression experiments. Moreover, at the individual
		  transcript level, it can sometimes be too large to allow
		  useful comparisons between treatment groups.

		  RESULTS: In this article we make two proposals that improve
		  the power, specificity and versatility of expression
		  analysis using RNA-seq data. First, we present a Bayesian
		  method for model selection that accounts for read mapping
		  ambiguities using random effects. This polytomous model
		  selection approach can be used to identify many interesting
		  patterns of gene expression and is not confined to
		  detecting differential expression between two groups. For
		  illustration, we use our method to detect imprinting,
		  different types of regulatory divergence in cis and in
		  trans and differential isoform usage, but many other
		  applications are possible. Second, we present a novel
		  collapsing algorithm for grouping transcripts into
		  inferential units that exploits the posterior correlation
		  between transcript expression levels. The aggregate
		  expression levels of these units can be estimated with
		  useful levels of uncertainty. Our algorithm can improve the
		  precision of expression estimates when uncertainty is large
		  with only a small reduction in biological resolution.},

		  RESULTS: On a set of human messenger RNAs with random
